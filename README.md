<!-- ## ✨ Features

[![][image-feat-privoder]][docs-feat-provider]

### `1` [Multi-Model Service Provider Support][docs-feat-provider]

In the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations. -->
